How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives the version ids and any description of the change done for that particular commit. This info can be used to identify the commit responsible for particular changes. The changes done can be identified by comparing that particular commit id with the commit id immediately preceeding it. The order can be confusing, so I prefer to check the date and time of the commits to identify the immediately preceeding commit id. Comparsion can be done using git diff id1 id2.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Knowing that I always have a backup of the last version of the working code. I can make changes to the code with more confidence without worrying to loose the stability of the code. Additionally I can also compare with the last version and find out which part of the code causes the break.
